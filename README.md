# Variables
* Variables are containers for storing data values
* A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc
* Python defines four types of variables: local, global
* They are four rules to create varibles they are :-
* Rule_1 :-vairables should not starts with a number if you want to starts with number please use underscore (_)
  Example:-6=78 # it trough a syntax error But,_6=78 after running this code you can print the vairable (6) then it give a out put 78
* Rule_2 :-vairable should be a single word are a single charecter But, not multiple words,if you want please use underscore(_)
  Example:-Rupa sri =100 #it through an syntax error but,Rupa_sri =100,when the vairable is printed then it give a out put 100
* Rule_3 :-Variable names are case-sensitive
  Example:-age=4 #it save in the memorey
            print(Age) #it through an error,because of in calling age in print we are using capital A
* Rule_4:-please don't allow these punctuations(#,@,$,%,^,&,*,;:'".></\()[]{}+_-?)
